## Building an Agent for Amazon Bedrock: Seamlessly Interact with Amazon DynamoDB and Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock using Natural Language.

[Agents for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) enable developers to create conversational agents that understand natural language through foundation models (FMs). In this blog post, I'll create an Amazon Bedrock Agent that allows users to interact with an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/dynamodb/) table and a [Knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) using natural language.

I'll guide you through setting up the resources, defining the agent's action groups, associating [AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) to execute DynamoDB operations, and integrating the knowledge base for enhanced conversational experiences to provide more personalized and context-aware responses to user queries. All this with a 'CDK deploy' command using the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

By the end, you'll understand how to build an intelligent conversational agent that simplifies database interactions, delivers personalized responses, and provides a user-friendly experience.

## How The App Works

![Digrama parte 1](/imagen/diagram.jpg)

This agent acts as the interface for the user to input information and make requests.

The user's actions trigger AWS Lambda functions based on [action group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-action-create.html) definition, actions that the agent can help the user perform three key actions: [SpanAppointment](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/lambdas/code/dynamodb_put_item/lambda_function.py), [GetAppointment](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/lambdas/code/dynamodb_query/lambda_function.py), and [AskTodayDate](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/lambdas/code/ask_date/lambda_function.py).

> Action group definition is in [ag_data.json](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/agent_appointment_manager/ag_data.json)

The SpanAppointment and GetAppointment functions interact with an [Amazon DynamoDB table](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/databases/databases.py). It stores and retrieves the appointment data as needed.

The AskTodayDate function retrieves the current date information, which is then relayed back to the user via the Agent for Amazon Bedrock. This allows the user to receive real-time updates and confirmations regarding their appointment scheduling actions.

Leveraging the information stored in the knowledge base, the agent can then offer personalized massage recommendations tailored to the customer's unique needs. It can suggest the most suitable massage types, durations, and any additional services that may enhance their spa experience and address their specific concerns.

For example, if a customer mentions neck pain and stiffness, the agent can draw from the knowledge base and recommend a deep tissue massage focused on the neck and shoulder area, combined with hot stone therapy for added relaxation and muscle relief.

## Let's build!

### Step 1:  APP Set Up 

✅ **Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb
```

✅ **Go to**: 

```
cd agent-appointment-manage
```

Create the Amzon Knowledge base by following [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html) and using [this data](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/spa-data), then in [kb_data.json](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/agent_appointment_manager/kb_data.json) edit the "knowledge_base_id" value:

```
    {
        "description_kb": "Recommend the best massage. Recommend the best massage according to the user's preferences",
        "knowledge_base_id": "XXXXXXXXXX"
    }
```
### Step 2: Deploy architecture with CDK.

✅ **Create The Virtual Environment**: by following the steps in the [README](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-appointment-manager-dynamodb/blob/main/agent-appointment-manager/README.md)

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
for windows: 

```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

✅ **Install The Requirements**:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

✅ **Synthesize The Cloudformation Template With The Following Command**:

```
cdk synth
```

✅🚀 **The Deployment**:

```
cdk deploy
```

## Enjoy the app!:

Try the agent in the [Amazon Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and improve the agent's instructions until you find the best result.


## Conclusion

In this blog post, you learned how to create an Amazon Bedrock conversational agent that allows users to interact with a Amazon DynamoDB table using natural language. 

The combination of Agents from Bedrock, DynamoDB, and natural language processing hrough foundation models (FMs) opens up exciting possibilities for building user-friendly applications. Users can interact with databases using plain language, making it easier for non-technical users to access and manipulate data.

I encourage you to explore further and extend the functionality of your conversational agent based on your specific requirements. With the right design and implementation, you can create intelligent agents that revolutionize the way users interact with data.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope this post has inspired you to create your own innovative solutions using Agents for Amazon Bedrock.
